## Analyzing Daily Average Time Spent on Playing Games

Problem Statement

Video games are a common source of entertainment, but spending too much time playing them can affect productivity, physical health, and mental well-being. By examining daily gaming habits, we aim to understand how time is allocated to gaming and identify ways to maintain a healthy balance between gaming and other activities.
##   ## About the Project

Video games are a common source of entertainment, but excessive gaming can impact productivity, physical health, and mental well-being. This project analyzes daily gaming habits using real-world data extracted from PlayStation gaming activity. The goal is to understand time allocation for gaming and its potential effects on well-being. 

With the rapid advancement of gaming technology, the accessibility and engagement levels of video games have significantly increased. Many individuals spend a considerable amount of time gaming, making it essential to study how gaming fits into their daily lives and how it may influence other activities such as work, study, and exercise.

### **Data Collection**
The dataset includes various factors related to gaming behavior and lifestyle habits:
- **Daily hours spent on gaming**: Tracking gaming duration to analyze trends and correlations.
- **Types of games played**: Categorizing games into genres such as casual, competitive, story-driven, or educational.
- **Sleep duration**: Evaluating the relationship between gaming hours and sleep quality.
- **Physical activity levels**: Measuring whether gaming habits impact exercise frequency and intensity.
- **Productivity scores**: Assessing work/study efficiency in relation to gaming frequency.
- **Recently played and purchased games**: Examining purchasing behavior and gaming preferences.

### **Research Objectives**
Using data analysis and machine learning, we aim to:
- Identify patterns in gaming habits across different demographics.
- Assess correlations between gaming time and well-being metrics such as sleep, mental health, and productivity.
- Provide insights for maintaining a balanced lifestyle by offering recommendations on time management and self-regulation in gaming.

## About CS210 Data Science Course

Data science is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting insights from large datasets through computational techniques. The CS210 course introduces students to fundamental concepts in data analysis and machine learning. This course covers:
- **Data collection and preprocessing**: Understanding raw data and cleaning it for meaningful analysis.
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and anomalies through visualization and summary statistics.
- **Basic statistical modeling**: Applying statistical techniques to analyze relationships between variables.
- **Visualization techniques**: Using graphs and charts to interpret and present data.
- **Machine learning fundamentals**: Implementing predictive models to uncover hidden trends in gaming behavior.

Through hands-on projects, students apply these techniques to real-world problems, making data-driven conclusions that can be useful for various applications, including behavioral research and user engagement studies.
